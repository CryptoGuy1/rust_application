# Hello Rust

This is a simple Rust application that uses the [`ferris-says`](https://crates.io/crates/ferris-says) crate to display a fun message from Ferris, the unofficial Rust mascot, in a speech bubble format.

---

## 📦 Project Structure

- `Cargo.toml` — Project manifest file containing dependencies.
- `Cargo.lock` — Auto-generated lock file for exact dependency versions.
- `src/main.rs` — Main Rust source file containing the application logic.

---

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Make sure you have Rust installed. If not, install it via:

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

2. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/hello-rust.git
cd hello-rust
```

3. Build and run the application:

```bash
cargo run
```

You should see Ferris saying:

```
 ----------------------------
< Hello fellow Rustaceans! >
 ----------------------------
            \
             \
               _~^~^~_
           \) /  o o  \ (/
             '_   -   _'
             / '-----' \
```
